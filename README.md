This site was an assignment for a short web design/ development course I took. Very simple but does involve some JQuery, and javascript. Just a basic project with minimal design


Download or clone and customize to your projects style.


For simplicity and learning I put the Jquery and javascript on the index.html file, you can put them in another file and link it. 
I just used it as an example for myself.
