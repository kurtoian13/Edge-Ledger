This site was an assignment for a short web design/ development course I took. Very simple but does involve some JQuery, and javascript. Just a basic project with minimal design


Download or clone and customize to your projects style.

Jquery and javascript are on the index.html file, you can put them in another file and link it. I just used it as an example for myself.
